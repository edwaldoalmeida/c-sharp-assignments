# C# Assignments

This assignments were developed for class assignments and they date from July 2018. They are far from great software, but what makes me proud of them is that they are a Milestone when I was resuming my career with a post-grad at the Conestoga College.

With the Software Development Techniques class I've reviewed not only important topics for software development, such as data types, data structures, control flow, Object Orientation etc., I've also learnt some modern and important concepts as indicated in each assignment description.
